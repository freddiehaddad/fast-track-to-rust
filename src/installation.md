# Installation

It is recommended to install the Rust development toolchain on your system.
After installation, you will have everything needed to build and run Rust code
on your computer.

Installation is accomplished using `rustup`, the Rust toolchain installer. Once
completed, you'll have `rustup`, `cargo`, and `rustc`.

Follow the instructions at [https://rustup.rs/] to complete the installation.

## Configuring your IDE

It is recommended (but not required) to configure your editor to work with Rust.
With Cargo installed, most editors, such as VS Code, will automatically install
[rust-analyzer], the LSP implementation for the Rust programming language.

# Struct

We're going to create a type to represent an interval. Rust follows a
standardized naming convention for types, where structures use
`UpperCamelCase`[^1] for "type-level" constructs. Therefore, we'll name our
`struct` `Interval`.

## Defining our Struct

Our closed interval is going to represent the start and end of the lines to
print:

```rust,noplayground
struct Interval {
    start: usize,
    end: usize,
}
```

## Defining Behavior

Functions and methods are added by defining them inside an `impl` block:

```rust,noplayground
impl Interval {
    // Methods definitions
}
```

## The `new` Function

As it is common convention in Rust to define a function called `new` for
creating an object, we'll begin by defining one to return an `Interval`.

```rust,noplayground
impl Interval {
    fn new(start: usize, end: usize) -> Self {
        Self { start, end }
    }
}
```

> The keyword `Self`
>
> The `Self` keywords in the return type and the body of the function are
> aliases for the type specified after the `impl` keyword, which in this case is
> `Interval`. While the type can be explicitly stated, the common convention is
> to use `Self`.

> Exclusion of the `return` keyword and (`;`)
>
> The `return` keyword is unnecessary when the returned value is the final
> expression in a function. In this scenario, the semicolon (`;`) is omitted.
> [^2]

## Methods

Recall from our rustle program that we merged overlapping intervals to prevent
printing the same line multiple times. It would be useful to create a method to
check if two intervals overlap and another method to merge overlapping
intervals. Let's outline these methods!

```rust,noplayground
fn overlaps(&self, other: &Interval) -> bool {
    todo!();
}

fn merge(&self, other: &Self) -> Self {
    todo!();
}
```

> The `todo!()` and `unimplemented!()` macros can be useful if you are
> prototyping and just want a placeholder to let your code pass type analysis.

### The `self` Method Receiver

You're probably accustomed to using the implicit `this` pointer (a hidden first
parameter) in your class methods. In Rust, the [`self`] keyword is used to
represent the receiver of a method and the convention is to omit the type for
this parameter. Depending on the intended behavior, it can be specified as
`self`, `&self` or `&mut self`.[^3]

> Omitting the type after `self` is syntactic sugar. It's short for
> `self: Self`. As `Self` is an alias to the actual type, the full expansion
> would be `self: Interval`, `self: &Interval` or `self: &mut Interval`.

## Implementing the Methods

Remember that our rustle program processes lines sequentially. This allows us to
optimize the detection of overlapping intervals. However, this approach limits
the versatility of our `Interval` type. As an exercise, you can work on making
it more generic.

### `overlaps`

The `overlaps` method is fairly straightforward. We check if the `end` of the
first interval is greater than or equal to the `start` of the next interval. The
only caveat is the order of the comparison.

```rust,noplayground
fn overlaps(&self, other: &Interval) -> bool {
    self.end >= other.start
}
```

### `merge`

The `merge` method returns a new `Interval` using the `start` of the first
interval and the `end` of the second. The same caveat applies: the receiver must
be the interval that comes first in the sequence.

In both cases, an immutable borrow for both intervals is sufficient since we do
not need to mutate either value.

```rust,noplayground
fn merge(&self, other: &Self) -> Self {
    Interval::new(self.start, other.end)
}
```

### Implementing `merge_intervals`

Rust programmers coming from a C++ background might be inclined to implement
this function using some variation of the following algorithm:

```rust,noplayground
fn merge_intervals(intervals: Vec<Interval>) -> Vec<Interval> {
    let mut merged_intervals: Vec<Interval> = Vec::new();

    let mut iter = intervals.into_iter();
    match iter.next() {
        Some(interval) => merged_intervals.push(interval),
        None => return merged_intervals,
    };

    for interval in iter {
        if let Some(previous_interval) = merged_intervals.last() {
            if previous_interval.overlaps(&interval) {
                let new_interval = previous_interval.merge(&interval);
                merged_intervals.pop();
                merged_intervals.push(new_interval);
            } else {
                merged_intervals.push(interval);
            }
        }
    }

    merged_intervals
}
```

While functionally correct, Rust features powerful crates that can make
implementing this behavior more concise. One such crate is [`Itertools`], which
provides extra iterator adaptors. To use this crate, specify it as a dependency
in `Crates.toml` and include it in `main.rs` with `use itertools::Itertools`.
Let's see how the [`coalesce`] adaptor can simplify the code:

```rust,noplayground
use itertools::Itertools;

fn merge_intervals(intervals: Vec<Interval>) -> Vec<Interval> {
    intervals
        .into_iter()
        .coalesce(|p, c| {
            if p.overlaps(&c) {
                Ok(p.merge(&c))
            } else {
                Err((p, c))
            }
        })
        .collect()
}
```

> `into_iter`
>
> In both implementations, we use `into_iter`, which creates a consuming
> iterator that moves each value out of the vector from start to end. This is
> another example of how we can take advantage of move semantics.
>
> NOTE: Because the iterator consumes the data, the vector cannot be used
> afterward.

## Updating Rustle

It's time to update our rustle program to utilize our new type. Additionally, a
few minor changes have been made to enhance the design, demonstrate some
additional language features, and leverage move semantics. Give the program a
run!

```rust
# #![allow(unused_imports)]
# extern crate regex; // this is needed for the playground
use itertools::Itertools;
# use regex::Regex;
# use std::fs::File;
# use std::io::Read;
# use std::io::{BufRead, BufReader};
# use std::process::exit;
#
# fn find_matching_lines(lines: &[String], regex: Regex) -> Vec<usize> {
#     lines
#         .iter()
#         .enumerate()
#         .filter_map(|(i, line)| match regex.is_match(line) {
#             true => Some(i),
#             false => None,
#         })
#         .collect() // turns anything iterable into a collection
# }

fn create_intervals(
    lines: Vec<usize>,
    before_context: usize,
    after_context: usize,
) -> Vec<Interval> {
    lines
        .iter()
        .map(|line| {
            let start = line.saturating_sub(before_context);
            let end = line.saturating_add(after_context);
            Interval::new(start, end)
        })
        .collect()
}

fn merge_intervals(intervals: Vec<Interval>) -> Vec<Interval> {
    // merge overlapping intervals
    intervals
        .into_iter()
        .coalesce(|p, c| {
            if p.overlaps(&c) {
                Ok(p.merge(&c))
            } else {
                Err((p, c))
            }
        })
        .collect()
}

fn print_results(intervals: Vec<Interval>, lines: Vec<String>) {
    for interval in intervals {
        for (line_no, line) in lines
            .iter()
            .enumerate()
            .take(interval.end + 1)
            .skip(interval.start)
        {
            println!("{}: {}", line_no + 1, line)
        }
    }
}

# fn read_file(file: impl Read) -> Vec<String> {
#     BufReader::new(file).lines().map_while(Result::ok).collect()

fn main() {
#     let poem = "I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me,
#                 And what can be the use of him is more than I can see.
#                 He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head;
#                 And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed.
#
#                 The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow -

#                 For he sometimes shoots up taller like an india-rubber ball,

}

struct Interval {
    start: usize,
    end: usize,
}

impl Interval {
    fn new(start: usize, end: usize) -> Self {
        Self { start, end }
    }

    fn overlaps(&self, other: &Interval) -> bool {
        self.end >= other.start
    }

    fn merge(&self, other: &Self) -> Self {
        Interval::new(self.start, other.end)
    }
}
```

## Summarizing the Changes

Our rustle program now makes use of our custom type and includes a few other
enhancements.

Let's review the changes:

`create_intervals` was updated with the following changes:

- The return type was changed to `Vec<Interval>`
- The tuple created from `start` and `end` are now used to create an `Interval`

`merge_intervals` was updated with the following changes:

- The argument `intervals` now has a type of `Vec<Interval>` and is _moved_
  instead of the mutable borrow
- `dedup_by` was replaced with `coalesce`

`print_results` was updated with the following changes:

- The argument `intervals` is now a `Vec<Interval>`
- The `take` and `skip` iterator adaptors were updated to use the fields from
  the `Interval`

> Each interval is _dropped_ at the end of the loop iteration when written as
> `for interval in intervals`. If the loop were written as
> `for interval in &intervals`, we would _borrow_ each value. The same applies
> if we had written the loop as `for interval in intervals.iter()`. The former
> is syntactic sugar for the latter.[^4]

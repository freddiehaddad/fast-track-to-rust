# Packages

A package is a collection of one or more crates that provide a set of
functionalities. It includes a `Cargo.toml` file that outlines how to build
those crates. A package can contain multiple binary crates, but only one library
crate at most. However, a package must contain at least one crate, whether it's
a library or binary crate.

Refer to the section on [Packages and Crates] in the Rust documentation.

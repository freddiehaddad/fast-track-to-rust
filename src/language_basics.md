# Language Basics

Rust includes the primitive types,[^1] statements, and expressions[^2] you're
already familiar with. However, it also incorporates some powerful concepts from
functional languages that we will explore throughout this course. To begin with
our rustle program, we'll keep things simple and gradually refactor the code to
introduce more of what Rust has to offer. Let's start with variables.

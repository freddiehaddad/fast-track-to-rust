# Dependencies

[crates.io] is the central [package registry] for the Rust community, serving as
a hub to discover and download packages. `cargo` supports adding and managing
[dependencies] for you and is configured to use the [package registry] by
default.

We're going to explore a few crates in this course:

- **[regex]**: An implementation of regular expressions for Rust
- **[itertools]**: Extra iterator adaptors, iterator methods, free functions,
  and macros
- **[clap]**: A simple to use, efficient, and full-featured Command Line
  Argument Parser

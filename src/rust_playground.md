# Rust Playground

In addition to running and editing code in the browser, you might find the [Rust
Playground] helpful. It's a web interface for running Rust code.

```rust,editable
fn main() {
    println!("Welcome to Fast Track to Rust!");
}
```

# Exercise

- Hover the mouse over the code block and click the arrow button to run the
  code.
- Modify the `"Welcome to Fast Track to Rust!"` string and re-run the code.
- Revert your changes by hovering your mouse over the code block and clicking
  the _Undo changes_ button.
- Run the hello world program in the [playground].
